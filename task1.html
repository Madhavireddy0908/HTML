    </strong></p>
    <h3>HTML uses</h3>
    <p><em>An application or web page may be created using the markup language HTML. HTML has established itself as a standard for web development when paired with JavaScript and CSS. HTML's ability to include scripts written in languages like JavaScript, which influence the behavior and content of web pages, is a useful feature. The arrangement and look of the material would change if CSS were included.

    <p><mark>HTML components are the fundamental building blocks of every HTML page. We may construct a structured document using structural-semantic spoken language, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, links, and other elements. The browser uses HTML tags to comprehend the content of the page even when they are not shown. One must first research several tags before recognizing their actions.
